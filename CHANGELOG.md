## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Added unit tests for `dequantize_per_channel_fp8_to_bf16` covering F32, BF16,
  and F16 scale dtypes, single-row, NaN handling, and validation errors
- Added fine-grained dequantization tests for all three scale dtypes (F32, BF16,
  F16) and multi-block F32 scale path
- Added CLI integration tests (`tests/cli.rs`) — 9 tests covering `parse`,
  `inspect`/`info`, `remember`/`dequantize`, error handling, and `--version`
- Documented single-scheme assumption in `detect_scheme` (all quantized tensors
  in a file use the same scheme; early-return on first scale companion found)
- CLI `parse` subcommand now displays the actual scale dtype (BF16, F16, F32)
  instead of always printing "F32"
- `inspect` Display now shows the actual scale dtype instead of hardcoded "F32"
- `dequantize_per_tensor_fp8_to_bf16` now uses `checked_mul` for output size,
  consistent with the other two dequantize functions (**breaking**: returns
  `Result<Vec<u8>>` instead of `Vec<u8>`)
- Fine-grained dequantization now validates that the scale grid is rectangular
  (rejects `scale_elements % scale_rows != 0` instead of silently truncating)
- `serialize_to_file` I/O errors now surface as `AnamnesisError::Io` instead of
  being misclassified as `AnamnesisError::Parse`
- `derive_output_path` now matches `TargetDtype` exhaustively instead of using a
  wildcard that would silently produce broken paths for future variants
- Simplified `shape_to_rows_cols` 2D arm: direct indexing with `// INDEX:`
  annotation instead of redundant `Option` unwrapping

### Added

- `FromStr` impl for `TargetDtype` — centralizes string-to-enum parsing so new
  variants cannot be silently missed in the CLI
- `ParsedModel::remember_with_progress()` — dequantize with a per-tensor
  callback, enabling progress reporting in CLI contexts
- `indicatif` progress bar during `remember`/`dequantize` when built with the
  `indicatif` feature (`amn remember` shows `[====================] 2.1s`)

## [0.1.0] — FP8 Dequantization

### Added

- **Safetensors parsing** (`src/parse/safetensors.rs`) — header parsing, tensor
  metadata extraction, dtype classification, tensor role classification (quantized,
  scale, passthrough), quantization scheme detection by scale tensor shape
- **Three FP8 dequantization schemes** (`src/remember/fp8.rs`):
  - **Fine-grained** — 128×128 block scale factors (`dequantize_fp8_to_bf16`)
  - **Per-tensor** — single scalar scale (`dequantize_per_tensor_fp8_to_bf16`)
  - **Per-channel** — one scale per output row (`dequantize_per_channel_fp8_to_bf16`)
- **Three scale dtypes** — `F32`, `BF16`, and `F16` scale tensors all supported
- **Branchless E4M3 → BF16 pipeline** — const subnormal lookup table, bitwise NaN
  select, round-to-nearest-even; auto-vectorized to SSE2 (default) and AVX2
  (`target-cpu=native`), verified with `cargo-show-asm`
- **Inspect module** (`src/inspect.rs`) — format, tensor counts, current/dequantized
  size estimates, Lethe distance
- **Parse-first public API** (`src/model.rs`) — `parse(path)` → `ParsedModel` →
  `.inspect()` / `.remember(path, target)`
- **CLI binary** (`src/bin/main.rs`) — subcommands: `parse`, `inspect`/`info`,
  `remember`/`dequantize`. Installed as both `anamnesis` and `amn`. Feature-gated
  behind `cli`
- **Cross-validation against PyTorch** — 7 fixtures from real models, bit-exact
  match (0 ULP on 65,536 elements each), 2.7–9.7× faster than PyTorch (AVX2)
- **Validated against 7 real models** from 5 quantization tools (LG AI, Qwen,
  Mistral, RedHat, NVIDIA)
